Especially for installations and performances it is crucial to record the artist’s intent, past iterations, and tacit knowledge involved in staging the artwork. The growing presence of contemporary artworks in museum collections increases the importance of documentation as a central focus of collection care. However, collections management systems have limitations in adequately presenting these often rich forms of documentation. Consequently, documentation required for presenting a speciﬁc complex artwork is often dispersed across multiple systems, drives, and dossiers inside various departments. In recent years, several initiatives responded to these challenges by implementing a digital platform supporting the conservation of contemporary art. Collaborative networked software such as wiki came into focus as a prominent choice for managing the related documentation. The wiki promises to integrate diverse material in one place and accommodate much-needed requirements such as multiple iterations of an artwork, relations between its elements, and multimedia content. This paper takes the case of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)’s experimental use of MediaWiki to determine whether and under what conditions a wiki is capable of supporting collection care suﬃciently in terms of documenting time-based media art. The case further illustrates the consequence of adopting a content management system as knowledge base for conservation. While collections management systems are designed primarily to handle objects using forms, wikis are publishing platforms in the ﬁrst place and provide a diﬀerent kind of framework for artwork records. They are designed to employ text and media to compose articles.

However, when it comes to the exhibition, locating relevant bits of information often yields a painstaking process. This paper takes the case of SFMOMA’s treatment of media installations and argues that documentation management is a threefold issue. Besides adapting information systems to the cause, of the same importance are the intra- and inter-institutional collaboration and the acknowledgment of the role of conservator as a content manager <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=2&amp;annotation=3LRYUVNU">(p. 2)</a></p> <p>presentation of these works demands supplanting the idea of restoring the original state of an artwork by that of installing its iterations and acknowledging the fact that through each installation the work changes anew <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=UDKMIXXL">(p. 3)</a></p> <p>So when not installed, the work cannot be perceived and only ‘exists’ in the form of instructions and documentation (Laurenson 2001; Phillips 2015, 173).2 This condition poses greater needs on documentation and its management, which in the case of such works is a complex matter (Heydenreich 2011). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=Z8GDN37X">(p. 3)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#2ea8e5] Interesting References</p> <p>Laurenson <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=KVVEWXJZ">(p. 3)</a></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#2ea8e5] Interesting References</p> <p>Phillips <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=WAHPER2J">(p. 3)</a></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#2ea8e5] Interesting References</p> <p>Heydenreich <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=ZYKTZKUC">(p. 3)</a></p></blockquote> <p>To document a time-based media artwork,3 Laurenson (2001) suggests to identify its components and elements (possibly including the space and acoustics), explain how they are connected, describe their roles in terms of aesthetics and functionality, and establish the factors most likely to prevent each component from fulfilling its role <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=E8GVZFU6">(p. 3)</a></p> <p>Laurenson (2006) later introduced into conservation research the concept of allographicity in order to expand the focus in media conservation from the materiality of painting and sculpture to also include temporality and ephemerality typical for media installations <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=YUAMQ4BW">(p. 3)</a></p> <p>Like in musical works, interpretation is often necessary and it constitutes the second phase of the work’s creation <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&amp;annotation=HHCWQ7SY">(p. 3)</a></p> <p>Building upon this concept, Phillips (2015) developed a model dividing the documentation work into two stages.

In consequence, while standard collections management systems are subjects to data entry where conservators fill out pre-existing forms, wikis are primarily publishing systems, allowing them to adapt templates to specificities of each artwork and so shape documentation in both content and form. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&amp;annotation=RGJQEUI6">(p. 14)</a></p> <p>As indicated above, standard museum information systems do not leave much room for variability and reduce artworks into fixed categories (Van Saaze 2013, 167). One consequence of this situation is that the amount of forms and entries per artwork is so high they need to be split into numerous panels, sidebars, menus, and screens. The resulting complexity prevents staff from consulting more than only certain aspects and fragments of a given artwork at once.
This makes it hard to grasp changing artworks such as installations and performances. The descriptive fixity of systems leads to complex interfaces <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&amp;annotation=FTEKDFBE">(p. 14)</a></p> <p>The consideration of content management alongside collection management requires rethinking the conservator’s role in documentation as well <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&amp;annotation=3T8BZ3C2">(p. 14)</a></p> <p>We argue that rather than data entry, the conservator documenting an artwork in this way does the work of editing. The tradition of editing offers a useful framework to conceptualise further this aspect of conservation. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&amp;annotation=SFCRWLZT">(p. 14)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#2ea8e5] Interesting References</p> <p>Susan L.

The people in those departments are the ones to reach out for collaboration. At the same time, documenting and editing artworks on a wiki may bring together the many voices of conservators, registrars, curators, and technicians in articulating the contributions of their own professions to the meaning and significance of works in their care.
It also sheds a new light on the often repeated statement that art installations only exist when they are installed.

In this article, I ask how constraints to knowledge and documentation sharing between institutions can be overcome. Over the past decades, there have been a number of initiatives for the inter-institutional exchange of documentation and research materials on the conservation of contemporary art. I focus on an online database project created by the International Network for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (INCCA) to share conservation documentation among practitioners in a semi-public setting. The main success of the INCCA database appears to have been to provide access to templates of forms and reports used in emerging practice, and to enable networking and increased exchange between members. I further identify the network as a research-based initiative and recognise its role in consolidating the conservation of contemporary art as a discipline.

Cet ouvrage collectif, en articulant différentes approches méthodologiques autour de la matérialité des archives, confirme l’importance d’aborder les expositions non seulement comme des événements à documenter, mais comme des agrégats matériels et immatériels à analyser dans leur forme, leur structure et leur processus d’accumulation. En travaillant sur la documentation numérique des composantes éphémères des expositions, je m’inscris dans cette perspective qui interroge à la fois les mutations induites par la transition numérique et les adaptations nécessaires des pratiques de description et de création de métadonnées.

Conventionally, visual artworks have been perceived as fixed, unique, material entities created and finished at a particular time, and museum approaches to collecting and preserving them were established accordingly. Nevertheless, contemporary art often resists this definition and undermines dogmas of material authenticity and artist’s intent, as well as the conviction that an object’s integrity resides in its physical features. Taking as its focus the triangle ofrelationships between an artist, a museum and a contemporary artwork as collectible, this study investigates how contemporary artworks by Mirosław Bałka, Danh Vo and Barbara Kruger are collected, documented and conserved in today’s institutions. It looks at how (and whether) new methods developed in the field of contemporary art conservation, such as the artist’s interview, are adopted by museums, and attempts to identify factors undermining their effectiveness. By looking at contemporary art as a new paradigm of artistic practice and building on notions such as musealisation, art project as art form and art object as document, this study works towards a theoretical model that address the incompatibility between a traditional museum approach to collecting and preserving and the features of contemporary art. By employing and extending concepts introduced by conservation theorist Hanna Hölling and the notion of ‘anarchives’ by media theorist Siegfried Zielinski, this study adopts the model of the ‘artwork-as-(an)archive’. Starting from the premise that our future understanding of contemporary artworks can only be constructed through traces of documentation, this model grants documents a status equal to that of art objects and obliges institutions to care for them on a similar basis. Besides its capacity to facilitate conservation, the artwork-as-(an)archive model is here considered as a space for collaboration between artists and museums, a space to be collectively shaped,filled and nourished that fosters transparency and inclusiveness.",tags:["subject//archive"],theme:"Archives",citation:"Wielocha, Agnieszka B. 2021. « Collecting Archives of Objects and Stories: On the Lives and Futures of Contemporary Art at the Museum ».

L’objectif principal est d’identifier les facteurs qui favorisent ou entravent l’efficacité de ces nouvelles approches et de proposer un modèle théorique capable de combler le fossé entre la nature changeante de l’art contemporain et les structures muséales établies.</p> <h3 id="idées-principales"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#idées-principales"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Idées principales</h3> <p>Le texte explore les enjeux liés à la conservation et à la documentation de l’art contemporain dans les musées, en mettant en évidence les défis que posent des œuvres souvent éphémères, conceptuelles, processuelles et variables aux pratiques muséales traditionnelles, historiquement conçues pour des objets matériels et stables.</p> <p>Dans ce contexte, la documentation est présentée comme un outil fondamental de conservation, jouant un rôle clé dans la préservation de l’identité des œuvres et dans l’orientation des décisions futures. Elle englobe notamment des informations sur les modalités de présentation, le contexte de création, l’état matériel de l’œuvre ainsi que les collaborations ayant contribué à sa réalisation.</p> <p>L’entretien avec l’artiste (artist interview) est identifié comme une méthode centrale dans la documentation à visée conservatoire. Il permet de recueillir des données précieuses sur les intentions, la signification et les dimensions matérielles des œuvres, et constitue un outil essentiel pour éviter des erreurs d’interprétation ou de conservation.</p> <p>Le texte interroge également le rôle de l’entretien dans l’ensemble documentaire constitué autour d’une œuvre : au-delà d’un simple recueil de faits, l’entretien est envisagé comme un assemblage de récits nécessitant une interprétation. Il contribue à construire une mémoire vivante de l’œuvre, où subjectivité et multiplicité des points de vue ont leur place.</p> <p>Cette approche rejoint l’idée de l’œuvre d’art comme archive — ou (an)archive — suggérant une relation intrinsèque entre œuvre et documentation. Dans ce modèle, l’archive ne se limite pas à un dépôt physique, mais devient un système dynamique de mémoire et de savoirs, qui valorise la pluralité des récits et accepte l’incomplétude comme constitutive.</p> <p>Le texte met en lumière les tensions existantes entre l’évolution des théories de la conservation de l’art contemporain et des pratiques institutionnelles parfois rigides. Ces frictions peuvent découler des systèmes de classification muséale, des structures administratives ou encore de la nature des relations entre artistes et institutions.</p> <p>L’étude appelle ainsi à une approche plus holistique et intégrée, prenant en compte l’œuvre dans sa globalité, à la fois physique et narrative. Elle plaide pour la collecte et la préservation active des récits des artistes et des parties prenantes, au même titre que les objets eux-mêmes.</p> <p>À travers l’analyse de cas concrets — notamment des œuvres de Mirosław Bałka et le <em>Chandeliers Project</em> de Danh Vo — le texte illustre les diverses stratégies adoptées par les institutions pour documenter, conserver et collaborer avec les artistes, tout en soulignant les défis rencontrés sur le terrain.</p> <p>Enfin, le texte propose un modèle théorique visant à combler le fossé entre la nature évolutive de l’art contemporain et les structures muséales traditionnelles, en accordant une place centrale aux récits et à la subjectivité dans les pratiques documentaires et conservatoires. Le rôle de l’archive institutionnelle y est également analysé, en tant qu’élément structurant de l’identité des œuvres et révélateur des dynamiques internes propres à chaque institution.</p> <h3 id="lien-avec-la-thèse"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lien-avec-la-thèse"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Lien avec la thèse</h3> <p>La documentation comme outil de conservation : La documentation est considérée comme un outil fondamental pour la conservation, en particulier pour l’art contemporain. p.31 Étant donné que l’art contemporain peut être éphémère, processuel ou variable dans ses supports, la documentation devient un moyen de préserver son identité et de permettre sa continuation. p.15</p> <p>La documentation d’une exposition enregistre la manière dont une œuvre a été présentée, y compris son installation, l’espace d’exposition et le contexte de sa monstration. p.90 Ces informations sont cruciales pour les décisions de conservation futures, car elles peuvent éclairer les intentions de l’artiste concernant la présentation et aider à maintenir l’intégrité de l’œuvre lors de futures expositions ou conservations. p.15</p> <p>La documentation réalisée lors d’une exposition (photographies d’installation, rapports de condition avant et après l’exposition) permet de suivre l’état de l’œuvre et d’identifier d’éventuels changements ou dommages survenus pendant la période d’exposition. p.90 Cela est essentiel pour la conservation préventive et curative. p.67</p> <p>La documentation peut également enregistrer les collaborations entre l’artiste, les conservateurs et les commissaires d’exposition lors de la préparation et du montage d’une œuvre pour une exposition. p.3 Ces échanges et les décisions prises concernant l’œuvre (par exemple, les instructions d’installation, les choix de matériaux) constituent des informations précieuses pour la conservation à long terme. p.132</p> <p>Intégration de la documentation dans la “constituante de l’œuvre” : Certains théoriciens proposent de considérer la documentation non pas comme un élément secondaire à l’œuvre, mais comme une partie intégrante de sa “constituante” ou de son “(an)archive”. p.15 Dans cette perspective, la documentation d’une exposition contribue à la définition et à la pérennisation de l’œuvre au même titre que l’objet physique. p.280</p> <p>Malgré cette importance, les sources soulignent que la documentation liée aux expositions est parfois dispersée dans différents services du musée (conservation, archives, service des expositions) et n’est pas toujours considérée comme une priorité au même titre que la conservation de l’objet lui-même. p.212 Il existe un plaidoyer pour une meilleure intégration et accessibilité de cette documentation. p.15</p> <p>%% begin annotations %%</p> <p>%% end annotations %%</p> <h3 id="bibliographie"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#bibliographie"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Bibliographie</h3> <p>%% Import Date: 2025-04-25T18:05:37.921-04:00 %%</p> <p><strong>Aben, K.

Les musées n’ont-ils pas pour mission d’exposer et de préserver leurs œuvres ? Mais c’est compter sans une extension inédite des biens culturels et la propension à y inclure les choses les plus diverses, à commencer par les plus contemporaines. En sorte que ces deux missions deviennent contradictoires. Les termes qui caractérisent cette situation nouvelle ("patrimoine", "curateur" qui s’est substitué à "commissaire", etc.) indiquent la grande transformation : sous l’effet du marché de l’art internationalisé et de la place qu’il occupe dans le monde de la finance, les œuvres sont désormais des biens qui, au même titre que d’autres, plus qu’une valeur ont un prix. S’ajoute l’importance prise par leur dimension contemporaine, puisque la mémoire dans nos sociétés est indissociable d’un rapport à l’histoire désormais centré non plus sur le passé mais sur le présent – un présent sans futur et qui est à lui-même son propre horizon. La patrimonialisation du présent brasse les cultures les plus hétérogènes, le passé et le présent, l’homogène et l’exogène, l’ordinaire et l’extraordinaire. Elle fait croître le souci qui entoure désormais les productions contemporaines y compris dans leurs composantes techniques, singulièrement créditées d’une valeur que leur obsolescence particulière rend d’autant plus digne d’intérêt.',tags:["c-r","performance","enquête","documentation","subject/esthétique","temps","philosophie","installation"],theme:"Conservation-restauration",citation:"Cometti, Jean-Pierre. 2016. _Conserver/Restaurer : l’oeuvre d’art à l’époque de sa préservation technique_.

Spécialisée en art contemporain et artefacts ethnologiques, les étudiants suivaient les méthodologie de l’enquête pragmatique.</p> <p>Cometti y examine les fondements philosophiques de la conservation des œuvres d’art, en discutant des concepts d’authenticité, d’intégrité et de valeur esthétique. L’ouvrage aborde les dilemmes éthiques auxquels sont confrontés les conservateurs et restaurateurs, notamment en ce qui concerne les interventions sur les œuvres d’art. Cometti explore comment les œuvres d’art évoluent avec le temps et les implications de cette évolution pour leur conservation et leur restauration.</p> <p>Cometti explorent les défis et les complexités de la conservation et de la restauration de l’œuvre d’art à une époque marquée par la remise en question des notions traditionnelles d’œuvre, d’identité, d’intégrité et d’authenticité, notamment sous l’influence des avant-gardes et de la reproductibilité technique. L’auteur souligne la nécessité d’une approche renouvelée qui prenne en compte le “fonctionnement” de l’œuvre plutôt que de se limiter à ses “propriétés” intrinsèques et son inscription dans des contextes d’usage et de réception.</p> <h3 id="idées-principales"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#idées-principales"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Idées principales</h3> <ul><li><strong>La notion d’œuvre est paradigmatique et source d’embarras :</strong> L’idée d’œuvre d’art n’est pas univoque et a évolué au cours de l’histoire. Le paradigme classique reposait sur des canons et une esthétique de l’ordre, trouvant son modèle dans des œuvres exemplaires. Cependant, la modernité et l’autonomisation du champ artistique ont introduit des “pratiques alternatives” revendiquant un statut comparable, voire supérieur.</li> <li><em>“La notion d’œuvre renferme en elle un paradigme, même si celui-ci s’accommode d’une pluralité de modèles, sources permanentes d’embarras dans l’histoire de l’art et de ses interprétations.”</em> (p. 15)</li> <li><em>“Une erreur serait toutefois de penser que ce paradigme consiste en un ensemble de canons auxquels les œuvres particulières doivent satisfaire pour bénéficier de ce statut…”</em> (p. 15)</li> <li><strong>L’héritage des avant-gardes remet en cause la totalité de l’œuvre :</strong> L’art d’avant-garde se caractérise par une remise en question de l’œuvre comme totalité organique. Des techniques comme le collage, le montage, l’assemblage et l’utilisation de matériaux ordinaires fragmentent l’unité et l’achèvement traditionnels. La signification des parties n’est plus médiatisée par le tout, mais peut être autonome. L’avant-garde réintègre l’art dans une expérience plus large, en prise avec le monde.</li> <li><em>“L’œuvre d’avant-garde remet en cause l’œuvre dans sa nature de totalité.”</em> (p. 18)</li> <li><em>“Dans le cas de l’œuvre de type organique, la signification de chacune des parties (discernables) passe par la médiation de la totalité qu’elles forment; dans le cas de l’œuvre d’avant-garde, cette signification est indépendante…”</em> (p. 19)</li> <li><em>“Par là, les pratiques des avant-gardes ont réintégré les arts dans le tissu d’une expérience plus large, en prise avec le monde et les évolutions du temps.”</em> (p. 19)</li> <li><strong>La distinction entre propriétés et fonctionnement est cruciale :</strong> L’approche traditionnelle de l’œuvre se concentre sur ses propriétés intrinsèques. Cependant, pour l’art d’avant-garde et certaines formes d’art contemporain (ready-made, art cinétique, arts allographiques), une appréciation en termes de “fonctionnement” (esthétique, sémiotique, contextuel) devient plus pertinente que la simple énumération des propriétés matérielles.</li> <li><em>“On devrait donc s’attendre à d’autres propriétés, susceptibles de se voir attribuer la pertinence qui fait défaut aux premières.”</em> (p. 27)</li> <li><em>“Deux hypothèses se présentent: a) ou bien les propriétés supposées aptes à définir les œuvres quant à leur statut d’œuvre et leur identité sont subordonnées à des conditions de fonctionnement; b) ou bien il faut carrément substituer à une appréciation en termes de propriétés une appréciation en termes de fonctionnement.”</em> (p. 29)</li> <li><em>“En considérant les choses sous ce jour, on ne peut donc que se rendre à l’évidence : les propriétés attribuables à des œuvres ne sont pas des propriétés que posséderaient certains objets […] mais des traits caractérisables sous certaines conditions au regard desquelles les propriétés attribuables aux objets qui leur correspondent ne jouent que partiellement et relativement.”</em> (p. 32)</li> <li><strong>La “Loi du tout” et la primauté de la signification :</strong> Dans le cadre de la conservation-restauration, l’attention doit se porter en premier lieu sur l’objet dans sa totalité significative. L’intérêt pour les parties est subordonné à celui porté au tout. La technologie ne doit pas primer sur la signification et la valeur patrimoniale ou artistique de l’objet.</li> <li><em>“La première chose qui s’impose donc à son attention concerne l’objet dans sa totalité (son intégrité si l’on veut), ce qui veut dire, au sens le plus strict, que l’intérêt susceptible d’être porté aux parties […] est subordonné à l’intérêt que l’on porte au tout comme totalité significative et que c’est ce type d’intérêt qui doit rester prédominant.”</em> (p. 38)</li> <li><em>“On ne peut donc pas impunément, lorsqu’on a affaire à des objets candidats à une fonction patrimoniale ou à un statut artistique, faire l’économie de la signification (qui conditionne la valeur) […] dans des termes qui répondent nécessairement à la Loi du tout.”</em> (p. 39)</li> <li><strong>L’identité de l’œuvre est dynamique et dépend de son fonctionnement et de ses usages dans le temps :</strong> L’identité d’une œuvre n’est pas fixée par ses seules propriétés matérielles à un instant donné. Elle évolue avec le temps et est liée à ses conditions d’activation, à son contexte de réception et à la continuité de ses usages. L’exemple du bateau de Thésée illustre cette relativité de l’identité.</li> <li><em>“L’identité d’une chose ou d’un être n’est donc que relative et l’ontologie qui s’y rapporte ne l’est pas moins.”</em> (p. 61)</li> <li><em>“Ici encore, comme le montre l’exemple du bateau de Thésée, la garantie de l’identité ou de la mêmeté […] réside dans une continuité plus ou moins grande, qui est celle des usages et d’un fonctionnement.”</em> (p. 61)</li> <li><em>“C’est toutefois oublier que ce ne sont pas les caractéristiques physiques et matérielles qui définissent un objet - et par conséquent son identité - mais les usages auxquels il se prête.”</em> (p. 71)</li> <li><strong>Les œuvres contemporaines et les objets ethnographiques posent des défis spécifiques à la conservation-restauration :</strong> Ces catégories d’objets remettent en question les approches traditionnelles centrées sur l’objet matériel autographique. Les œuvres interactives, les installations intégrant des technologies, le street art, et les objets ethnographiques nécessitent de prendre en compte leur dimension contextuelle, leur fonctionnement, leur réception et parfois leur caractère éphémère ou leur inscription dans des pratiques sociales et culturelles spécifiques.</li> <li><em>“Il ne va pas de soi que les produits des arts contemporains […] puissent être inscrits sans autre précaution dans les mêmes perspectives [que les œuvres canoniques pour la conservation-restauration].”</em> (p. 90)</li> <li><em>“Le fait que les objets « ethnographiques » doivent leur sens à la place qu’ils occupent dans des activités socialisées […] ne doit cependant pas faire penser qu’ils sont étrangers à toute dimension « esthétique »…”</em> (p. 114)</li> <li><strong>La notion d’intention de l’artiste est problématique pour la conservation-restauration :</strong> Accorder une primauté à l’intention originelle de l’artiste dans les décisions de conservation est illusoire et réducteur. La signification de l’œuvre dépasse l’intention de son créateur et évolue dans le temps à travers sa réception.</li> <li><em>“Certaines notions - et aussi certaines habitudes-, comme celles d’intention et d’authenticité, se révèlent sous ce rapport embarrassantes et ambiguës, car elles tendent à réduire à une seule dimension (psychologisante) les conditions qui entrent dans la constitution d’un objet et dans ce qui lui donne son sens.”</em> (p. 191)</li> <li><em>“Il ne va nullement de soi que le but recherché soit (doive être) de préserver ce qu’on se représente comme l’intention première de l’artiste…”</em> (p. 191)</li> <li><em>“Une œuvre d’art est toujours beaucoup plus que ce qu’un artiste a voulu y mettre ; elle appartient à un monde et c’est en définitive cela qui est le plus important.”</em> (p. 220)</li> <li><strong>La conservation-restauration doit adopter une approche philosophique et contextuelle :</strong> Plutôt que de s’en remettre à des normes rigides et à une métaphysique de l’objet, la conservation-restauration doit s’engager dans une réflexion philosophique qui prenne en compte la précarité des a priori, la singularité des objets et leurs contextes d’usage. Le “constat d’état” lui-même doit être envisagé non pas comme une simple description objective, mais comme une évaluation ancrée dans des attentes et des “jeux de langage”.</li> <li><em>“L’intérêt de la conservation-restauration, pour le philosophe, consiste à mettre en lumière la précarité de tout a priori et à soumettre les concepts à l’épreuve du singulier…”</em> (p. 184)</li> <li><em>“L’enquête relative à ces propriétés est donc tout naturellement orientée vers des usages et des contextes d’usages qui, pour un objet donné, en définissent la fonctionnalité, c’est-à-dire sa signification dans ce qu’on pourrait appeler avec Wittgenstein un «jeu de langage».”</em> (p. 223)</li> <li><strong>Le champ du patrimoine s’est considérablement élargi :</strong> La multiplication des objets et des pratiques considérés comme biens culturels a étendu le champ d’intervention de la conservation-restauration. Un transfert de valeurs et de compétences s’opère vers des objets qui n’étaient pas traditionnellement destinés à la conservation des œuvres d’art.</li> <li><em>“On conçoit que dans ces conditions le champ d’intervention et de compétence du conservateur-restaurateur se soit considérablement élargi et qu’une foule d’objets qui n’y étaient pas spécialement destinés ait hérité des valeurs et des soucis qui, traditionnellement, se concentraient sur les œuvres d’art.”</em> (p. 205)</li></ul> <h3 id="lien-avec-la-thèse"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lien-avec-la-thèse"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Lien avec la thèse</h3> <p>Le premier lien avec ma thèse est certainement que j’ai reçu les enseignements de Cometti lors de mes études à l’ESAA. Mes pratiques sont intrinsèquement influencée par ses approches. Cometti plaide pour une approche de la conservation-restauration qui dépasse la simple préservation matérielle de l’objet pour embrasser une compréhension de son identité dynamique, de son fonctionnement dans des contextes spécifiques et de sa signification culturelle et historique. Cette approche renouvelée est essentielle pour faire face aux défis posés par les formes d’art contemporaines et les objets patrimoniaux qui ne se conforment pas aux modèles traditionnels de l’œuvre d’art autographique. Cometti a permis d’avoir un texte théorique en français sur ces questions et je m’en servirais de base pour pour explorer la conservation-restauration d’un nouvel objet d’étude comme l’exposition.</p> <h3 id="lactivation"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lactivation"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>L’activation</h3> <p>Dans cet ouvrage, Cometti propose un déplacement conceptuel majeur dans la compréhension des œuvres d’art : il suggère que leurs propriétés ne doivent pas être appréhendées comme des qualités intrinsèques, mais comme des effets produits dans des conditions d’activation données. Ce cadre théorique met l’accent sur les modes de fonctionnement, les usages et les contextes de réception, éléments qui deviennent centraux pour définir ce qu’est une œuvre. Il s’agit d’une pensée relationnelle de l’objet artistique, profondément ancrée dans une tradition pragmatiste, où l’œuvre n’existe que dans et par son activation.</p> <p>Envisager les œuvres sous l’angle de leurs conditions d’activation permet de mieux saisir la spécificité de certains dispositifs contemporains – installations, performances, environnements – qui ne se réduisent pas à une matérialité stable, mais exigent d’être réactualisés, réactivés, pour faire sens. Cometti invite à intégrer ces dimensions dans les processus de documentation et de conservation, non comme de simples compléments, mais comme des conditions constitutives des œuvres elles-mêmes.</p> <p>Ainsi, documenter une exposition, ce n’est pas seulement enregistrer ses composants matériels, mais aussi rendre compte des contextes, des usages, des gestes, des perceptions qui en assurent le fonctionnement symbolique et esthétique. L’approche de Cometti permet donc d’appuyer théoriquement une conception processuelle, contextuelle et dynamique de la mémoire des expositions, en lien direct avec les humanités numériques et les ontologies relationnelles que je mobilise dans ma recherche.</p> <h3 id="la-reconstitution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#la-reconstitution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>La reconstitution</h3> <p>Cometti explore la notion de reconstitution, qu’il distingue partiellement de celle de restauration. À propos de la reconstitution de l’exposition constructiviste Obmokhou (1921) ou du Merzbau de Schwitters, il suggère que la reconstitution, dans certains cas – notamment pour les installations – peut être envisagée comme une forme de restauration (p. 98). La différence entre les deux tiendrait moins à leur nature qu’à leur finalité : la restauration tend à figer l’objet dans une unicité matérielle, tandis que la reconstitution accepte un processus de recréation à partir de traces ou de documents. Ce déplacement de perspective est fondamental pour ma recherche, qui interroge les formes de documentation permettant de rendre intelligible et rejouable une exposition ou une œuvre dont le support est instable ou immatériel.</p> <p>Cometti discute également des concepts de réplique, de réitération et de restitution dans des contextes variés : des répliques techniques du Licht-Raum-Modulator de Moholy-Nagy (p. 210) aux cas célèbres comme Lascaux, où la notion de copie trouble les catégories traditionnelles de l’original et du double (p. 80). Pour les arts allographiques (musique, théâtre, performance), la réitération est même envisagée comme un mode d’existence et de conservation des œuvres (p. 209), et Cometti propose de penser la restauration elle-même comme une forme de réitération (p. 210), ce qui ouvre des perspectives fécondes sur la muséographie contemporaine.</p> <p>Il évoque aussi des pratiques de réinstallation et des exemples de reprises d’œuvres performatives, comme celles de Marina Abramović ou de Gary Hill (p. 208), rejoignant ainsi les préoccupations actuelles autour du reenactment sans utiliser ce terme directement. Ces formes de rejouement posent des questions essentielles à ma thèse. Cometti offre ici un cadre conceptuel pour aborder la documentation comme un acte interprétatif et dynamique, plutôt qu’une entreprise de figement, ce qui renforce ma proposition d’outils numériques adaptables aux œuvres activables ou reconstituées.</p> <h3 id="le-temps"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#le-temps"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Le temps</h3> <p>Cometti remet également en question la pertinence de la catégorie d’« œuvre éphémère », souvent utilisée pour désigner certaines productions contemporaines. Il souligne que toute œuvre est en réalité soumise au temps, ce qui rend le qualificatif d’« éphémère » trop vague, voire vide de sens s’il n’est pas précisé (p. 92-93). Toutefois, il admet que le terme peut garder une valeur opératoire lorsqu’il désigne des pratiques artistiques qui relèvent du régime de l’événement ou de l’action, et non de l’objet. Ce sont les œuvres dont le mode d’existence est temporellement situé, comme les performances, les protocoles, les reconstitutions, ou les occurrences fondées sur une partition ou un texte.</p> <p>Cette distinction est particulièrement féconde pour ma recherche. En effet, elle invite à penser ces productions non plus en termes d’objet à conserver, mais d’événement à retracer, rejouer ou interpréter. Cometti oppose ici la logique de la restauration – applicable aux œuvres objectales – à celle de l’activation ou de la réitération, plus pertinente pour les œuvres allographiques ou performatives. Il rejette l’idée que ces œuvres puissent être « restaurées » au sens classique du terme, comme une sculpture ou un retable ; elles doivent plutôt être documentées de manière à permettre leur compréhension, leur mémoire ou leur éventuelle réactivation, dans le respect de leur nature processuelle.</p> <p>Cette lecture éclaire le cœur de ma thèse, qui propose des outils numériques pour mieux archiver, contextualiser et transmettre les composantes temporelles, relationnelles et activables des expositions. Elle rejoint l’idée que l’éphémère n’est pas un défaut à compenser, mais une propriété à reconnaître et à intégrer dans les dispositifs de patrimonialisation. Par là, Cometti offre une base théorique solide pour défendre une documentation élargie, capable de rendre compte des temporalités propres aux expositions et aux œuvres qu’elles présentent, au-delà du seul paradigme de la permanence matérielle.</p> <p>Cependant, je critiquerais cette approche car elle sépare les oeuvre “complexes” des œuvres “traditionnelles” alors que mes hypothèses me portent à penser que le modèle que je propose est finalement applicable à toutes les œuvres.</p> <h3 id="citations-importées-le-2025-04-18-811-pm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#citations-importées-le-2025-04-18-811-pm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Citations importées le 2025-04-18 8:11 pm</h3> <p>Elle est solidaire des évolutions que le monde a connues, économiquement et socialement, de l’expérience du temps et des orientations de la culture qui leur sont concomitantes 3. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=6&amp;annotation=I7MVYP4K">(p. 6)</a></p> <p>L’importance prise par la mémoire n’est pas dissociable d’un rapport à l’histoire centré sur le présent, et la notion actuelle de patrimoine semble l’avoir encore renforcée en se conjuguant à des tendances qui ont vu coïncider la mondialisation de l’économie et l’idée d’un patrimoine de l’humanité4. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=6&amp;annotation=FQ6VC3Q2">(p. 6)</a></p> <p>ils s’inscrivent au cœur d’une évolution commune ayant consacré un rapport au temps qui ne se pense plus fondamentalement par rapport à un futur, mais dans la forme d’un présent qui en constitue l’horizon majeur sinon unique 5 <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=6&amp;annotation=D3AQKQVV">(p. 6)</a></p> <p>La conservation et la restauration ont une histoire plus ancienne, mais les enjeux dont elles sont aujourd’hui investies ne sont pas dissociables des conditions et des évolutions qui ont dessiné le visage actuel de la culture, sa fonction économique - directe ou indirecte - et la valeur particulière qu’y prend la mémoire, que ce soit au regard d’un rapport au temps marqué par le présent ou par rapport aux intérêts qu’elle est à même de servir à un stade de l’évolution du monde et du capitalisme qui ne parvient plus à se projeter dans un futur épousant la forme du progrès. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=6&amp;annotation=6SABB9UH">(p. 6)</a></p> <p>les pratiques de la conservation et de la restauration étaient essentiellement tournées vers le passé.

Dans la philosophie grecque, elle entre directement en rapport avec ce qui oppose les philosophies du devenir (Héraclite) et celles de l’être un, immobile et éternel (Parménide). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=54&amp;annotation=9X67LERR">(p. 54)</a></p> <p>Logiquement et ontologiquement, toutefois, la notion d’identité enveloppe l’idée du même (de ce qui est et reste le même) : a= a <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=55&amp;annotation=CTVRUANJ">(p. 55)</a></p> <p>Bien entendu, ce souci doit faire face aux effets du temps et aux altérations qu’il induit. Altérer, c’est rendre autre. Le conservateur-restaurateur est donc supposé répondre à une double exigence. Il lui faut préserver la mémoire, c’està-dire l’identité des objets qui entrent dans son champ de compétence, mais comme ces objets sont des objets historiques (soit qu’ils appartiennent au passé soit qu’ils y soient de toute façon destinés), ce souci de préservation s’accomplit dans un ensemble de procédures qui n’ont de sens que par rapport à des altérations réelles ou potentielles, si bien que l’identité postulée ne peut pas être purement et simplement l’identité logique du principe d’identité. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=55&amp;annotation=EPDUWD5W">(p. 55)</a></p> <p>On retrouve, pour cette raison, les trois axes du temps - le passé, le présent et le futur - dans 1) la conservation tout court (préservation en l’état) ; 2) la conservation préventive (conservation par anticipation) ; 3) la restauration. Le sens des notions d’intégrité et d’authenticité est lié à cela. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=55&amp;annotation=X3ZICPJZ">(p. 55)</a></p> <p>Les altérations auxquelles tout objet est inévitablement exposé (physiquement) sont de nature à modifier son état et à en menacer l’intégrité, au sens précédemment défini. L’identité peut donc à tout moment, pour cette raison, être menacée : comment s’assurer qu’une chose à l’instant tl est bien la même qu’à l’instant t ou, en tout cas, que ce qui entre en propre dans sa définition est préservé? Et comment peut-on en outre s’assurer que l’état dans lequel elle se trouve n’interdit pas (ou n’obscurcit pas) la connaissance de son état originel (et par conséquent de son identité) ? <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=56&amp;annotation=5JKCSSVW">(p. 56)</a></p> <p>L’identité (la connaissance qu’on en a) passe par une évaluation qui concerne son intégrité, laquelle ne va pas davantage de soi dans la mesure où elle présuppose à son tour un jugement sur son identité. En outre, comme nous l’avons vu plus haut, l’identité d’une chose, si l’on entend par là ce qu’elle est, ne doit-elle pas intégrer ce que nous sommes pourtant amenés à considérer comme des altérations ou des modifications <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=56&amp;annotation=UFLWI8YN">(p. 56)</a></p> <p>de son état originel? Quitte à nous répéter, un individu, à tel ou tel moment de son existence, n’est-il pas, comme on dit parfois, ce qu’il est devenu? Et si l’on devait en figer l’existence dans ce qu’il est à un moment de celle-ci, serait-il encore lui-même ? Sans doute cette question ne se pose-t-elle pas dans les mêmes termes pour un être humain, voire un animal, et un objet. Pensons au bateau de Thésée. Le bateau qui a surmonté toutes les tempêtes et qui a dû être réparé en mer à cette fin est-il le même que le bateau qu’il était au départ? Oui, bien sûr, et pas seulement parce qu’on lui a conservé le même nom, mais parce que pour les choses comme pour les êtres, ce qui se fixe à la manière d’une chose dans des propriétés ou un état donné renvoie à l’ensemble des conditions impliquées dans ces propriétés ou cet état, et par conséquent dans ce qui vient s’inscrire dans des processus dont ils émergent comme des configurations provisoires, plus ou moins stables, mais susceptibles d’intégrer les modifications qui les affectent. L’identité d’une chose ou d’un être n’est donc que relative et l’ontologie qui s’y rapporte ne l’est pas moins. Les planches dont le bateau de Thésée est rafistolé lui appartiennent tout autant - comme le bateau qu’il est - que celles qu’il a abandonnées en mer, offertes à d’éventuels naufragés ou livrées à d’autres courants. Au reste, soit dit en passant, c’est une attitude erronée que celle qui s’attache à des propriétés comme à des clous sur une planche. Ici encore, comme le montre l’exemple du bateau de Thésée, la garantie de l’identité ou de la mêmeté, si l’on préfère, réside dans une continuité plus ou moins grande, qui est celle des usages et d’un fonctionnement. La conservation-restauration est exposée aux mêmes situations et aux mêmes problèmes. Un objet appartenant au passé est destiné à connaître à peu près les mêmes péripéties, et si la question de son identité se pose (comme elle se pose), c’est en ce sens que sa continuité, c’est-à- <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=57&amp;annotation=DSM37L5L">(p. 57)</a></p> <p>La plupart des œuvres du passé, parmi celles que nous connaissons et admirons, ont une histoire qui peut certes ressembler à celle de notre bateau, mais à un moindre degré. Beaucoup ont été restaurées et l’on sait ce que cela peut vouloir dire du point de vue de ce que nous nous attachons à préserver aujourd’hui. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=58&amp;annotation=7U8GMWLN">(p. 58)</a></p> <p>L’état supposé primitif est moins un état qui demanderait à être défini dans ses propriétés essentielles qu’une détermination temporelle qui ne va certes pas sans caractérisations de diverses natures (intrinsèques et contextuelles 6), mais qui marque surtout un point d’origine dans une histoire ou un récit, et qui ne serait rien, précisément, s’il ne marquait le début d’un processus. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=58&amp;annotation=FSTGZMUZ">(p. 58)</a></p> <p>L’authenticité (l’identité historiquement située) et l’intégrité (l’identité ontologiquement définie), en ce sens, ne peuvent apparemment absorber les aléas de la temporalité (si significatifs soient-ils et en dépit de ce que l’objet en intègre à tel ou tel moment de son histoire) que sur un mode indirect et pour ainsi dire négatif (au sens où on utilise ce mot en photographie) : la marque du temps et par conséquent, paradoxalement, les propriétés particulières que présentent à nos yeux les objets fanés, à l’image des anciennes photos passablement jaunies, et qui y trouvent précisément une part de leur aura. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=60&amp;annotation=PE3YTAAI">(p. 60)</a></p> <p>La position de Cesare Brandi, à cet égard, est tout à fait instructive ; elle marque cette nécessaire intégration, sans laquelle la restauration ressemblerait à une entreprise désespérée visant à retrouver un état initial désormais révolu et à redonner l’éclat du neuf à ce qui ne l’est plus, comme pour en produire un simulacre. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=60&amp;annotation=68DYHLHC">(p. 60)</a></p> <p>C’est en tout cas pourquoi l’identité d’une œuvre ou d’un objet, dès lors qu’ils sont pris dans une histoire et dans un contexte culturel qui les rendent accessibles, en même temps qu’ils en spécifient les modalités d’accès, n’est pas l’égalité a= a. Là où nous pensons avoir affaire à une relation qui met en jeu des propriétés inhérentes à une chose, de nature à définir ce qu’est une chose et ce qui persiste d’elle à deux moments du temps, nous avons plutôt affaire à une relation à trois termes, et non pas à deux termes, comme dans la théorie du signe de Peirce, qui substitue une triade à une dyade. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=65&amp;annotation=I5GES7II">(p. 65)</a></p> <p>théorie dynamique qui intègre le temps, le mouvement et par conséquent les changements. D’une certaine manière, c’est parce que les êtres vivants changent que se pose la question de leur identité et qu’une identité leur est attribuée ; elle est la condition sous laquelle le changement n’est pas le pur et simple tourbillon auquel pensait peut-être Héraclite et qui effrayait tant Platon. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=66&amp;annotation=378S4IR5">(p. 66)</a></p> <p>Les objets, dans leur matérialité, peuvent paraître ne pas répondre à ces conditions. La théorie du spectateur peut sembler davantage adaptée à cela. Leur être ou leur mode d’être est tautologique et les dégradations physiques leur sont fatales, au sens où amputés de l’une de leurs propriétés, ils cessent d’être ce qu’ils étaient. Seules les relations que nous entretenons avec eux les en préserve. Un fauteuil auquel manque un pied n’est plus le même fauteuil, ce n’est même plus un fauteuil du tout, sinon dans le souvenir que j’en ai et au regard de ce qu’il me rappelle.Je peux lui conserver mon affection, le conserver dans mon grenier ou alors le faire réparer, mais comme fauteuil, même réparé il n’est plus le même. À première vue, il en va ainsi de tous les objets, y compris de ces artefacts particuliers que sont <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=66&amp;annotation=45K6U5FE">(p. 66)</a></p> <p>les œuvres d’art, des objets rituels et de culte, des monuments, etc. C’est toutefois oublier que ce ne sont pas les caractéristiques physiques et matérielles qui définissent un objet - et par conséquent son identité - mais les usages auxquels il se prête. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=67&amp;annotation=2BNCXWKJ">(p. 67)</a></p> <p>contextes d’usages <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=67&amp;annotation=5B2UGTPJ">(p. 67)</a></p> <p>Le bateau de Thésée, pour y revenir une dernière fois, n’arrive pas à bon port tel qu’en lui-même parce qu’il n’a pas fondamentalement changé. S’il est encore le même, bien qu’on en ait peut-être remplacé toutes les planches, c’est parce que ces planches ont été remplacées l’une après l’autre par des marins qui n’ont pas quitté le bord, et qui ont pu, malgré les avanies, effectuer la traversée. Pour la théorie du spectateur, seules comptent les planches; pour une théorie pragmatique, centrée sur tout ce qui s’est passé pendant tout ce temps-là, c’est essentiellement le fait que le navire a continué à naviguer. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=67&amp;annotation=JVJ4DT7A">(p. 67)</a></p> <p>La conservation-restauration emprunte probablement trop à la théorie du spectateur et insuffisamment à une philosophie des usages, d’où ses embarras avec les notions <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=67&amp;annotation=HN6H78NH">(p. 67)</a></p> <p>d’œuvre, d’intentionnalité et d’identité.

On peut rapprocher cette idée de ce que suggérait Nietzsche, dans un texte célèbre : « Celui qui appartient véritablement à son temps, le vrai contemporain, est celui qui ne coïncide pas parfaitement avec lui ni n’adhère à ses prétentions, et se définit, en ce sens, comme inactuel; mais précisément par cet écart et cet anachronisme, il est plus apte que les autres à percevoir et à saisir le temps 6. » En ce sens, le contemporain, c’est l’intempestif <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=84&amp;annotation=DB7L54K7">(p. 84)</a></p> <p>a conservation-restauration s’est longtemps concentrée sur des œuvres consacrées, dont la valeur était pour une large part liée à l’éminence supposée de leur place dans l’histoire de l’art et de la création artistique - autant de facteurs qui communiquent avec ce qu’on a fini par idéaliser dans l’art à partir d’une époque et dans certaines époques plus particulièrement. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=85&amp;annotation=9V56Y23K">(p. 85)</a></p> <p>en retiendrai trois : l’obsolescence, le caractère éphémère et l’immatérialité. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=86&amp;annotation=GHNB6W53">(p. 86)</a></p> <p>Une première remarque, qui vaut pour les deux cas, consiste à rappeler que l’obsolescence est le simple fait de ce qui ne dure pas, se dégrade et perd soit son identité soit ses capacités de fonctionnement.

Le fait est qu’étant le plus souvent subordonnées à une inscription dans le temps qui bénéficie d’une reconnaissance d’articité, elles ne peuvent le préserver qu’en pérennisant ce qu’il y avait en elles de fugace. Les ontologies transitoires sont ainsi converties en ontologies pérennes, mais à un prix qui ressemble beaucoup à une requalification forcée.

Lorsque la figure pleine de l’auteur vacille sous l’effet d’une problématisation constitutive de l’œuvre, et lorsque par conséquent les œuvres finissent pour ainsi dire par chasser leur auteur, comme la littérature et l’art du xxe siècle en donnent tant d’exemples, ou lorsque le bruit investit le corps même des œuvres, les problèmes de la conservation et de la restauration tendent à être euxmêmes privés de leur objet et la légitimité qu’ils conservent ou qu’on leur attribue marquent l’emprise ou la résistance d’un monde de l’art qui trouve alors un appui dans les dispositions juridiques et dans les intérêts auxquels il est associé. Sous tous ces aspects, les évolutions que les pratiques artistiques ont connues au xxe siècle peuvent être tenues pour décisives, en dépit de ce que nos habitudes contribuent à masquer. Un aspect important, de ce point de vue, réside dans le type de continuité auquel je faisais allusion précédemment. Cette continuité constitue un aspect de la compatibilité qui caractérise une bonne partie de l’art d’aujourd’hui, et que l’on peut considérer comme une composante des changements de paradigmes qui ont commencé à s’imposer dès le début du xxe siècle avec le collage et le ready-made. Ce changement a essentiellement consisté à introniser le « concept » ou le « geste » comme <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=154&amp;annotation=8R9D5D9S">(p. 154)</a></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>artistiquement décisif.

Le point majeur, de ce point de vue, réside dans la nature de ce qui fait la différence, à savoir que ce n’est plus l’objet, au regard de ses propriétés identifiables, mais l’initiative ou l’action qui en définissent - et modifient le statut qui deviennent dès lors décisives. Ce serait certes une erreur de penser qu’un décret suffit 21,mais l’indifférence duchampienne n’en prend pas moins ici tout son sens : les objets sont sans qualités et l’on peut avoir de bonnes raisons de penser que cette « absence de qualités » concerne bien plus que les «objets» qui en ont assuré le surgissement dans l’art et dans la culture 22. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/64EEZPA2?page=155&amp;annotation=ERS5CEU8">(p. 155)</a></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>On peut en mesurer les conséquences sur le double plan du droit et de la conservation-restauration à la lumière du vandalisme ou des actes vandales.

Leur disparition et leurs altérations sont inscrites à leur principe.

Les autrices, Jessica A. Cooley et Ann M. Fox, s’interrogent sur la signification du soin à une époque où il peut sembler omniprésent et proposent une approche curatoriale ancrée dans trois principes fondamentaux : la collaboration comme soin, l’intersectionnalité comme soin et l’accès comme soin. Le texte est né du projet d’exposition “Indisposable: Structures of Support after the ada”, initialement conçu pour commémorer le trentième anniversaire de l’Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), mais dont la portée a été profondément transformée par la pandémie de COVID-19 et les mouvements pour la justice raciale.</p> <h3 id="idées-principales"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#idées-principales"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Idées principales</h3> <ul><li><strong>Genèse du Projet :</strong> L’exposition “Indisposable” a été commandée par la Ford Foundation Gallery en janvier 2020. Les autrices soulignent l’importance de présenter la disability au sein d’une institution axée sur la justice sociale, notant que la disability est “everywhere and nowhere at the same time; it is omnipresent as a heavily determined signifier, yet those tropes need defamiliarization, particularly in visual representations.” Elles souhaitaient aller au-delà de l’accessibilité physique pour explorer la nature créative de la disability et l’esthétique du handicap.</li> <li><strong>Impact de la Pandémie et de la Justice Raciale :</strong> La pandémie et les demandes de justice pour les personnes noires ont conduit les curatrices à recentrer leur projet pour aborder les questions urgentes de ce moment, en reconnaissant l’intersectionnalité de la pandémie et de la justice raciale et en se demandant pourquoi certaines vies sont considérées comme jetables (“disposable”).</li> <li><strong>Manifeste pour la “Crip Curation as Care” :</strong> Le texte se présente comme un manifeste et un guide appelant les artistes et les curateurs à créer un art “crip” qui ne considère pas la disability comme une question isolée. Il s’agit d’un appel à prendre soin de la manière dont l’identité est toujours informée par l’ensemble de nos expériences et comment les identités intersectionnelles sont piégées par les valeurs oppressives de la société validiste, suprémaciste blanche et hétéropatriarcale. L’objectif est d’insister sur notre propre “indisposability”.</li> <li><strong>Réinvention de l’Exposition :</strong> Face à la pandémie, l’exposition traditionnelle en personne a été transformée en une série de huit commandes vidéo diffusées en ligne (“chapters”) entre mi-2020 et début 2022. Chaque chapitre, fruit d’une collaboration avec un artiste, explorait des questions liées à l’indisposability en lien avec la COVID-19 et la violence envers les communautés BIPOC.</li> <li><strong>Trois Principes de Soin dans la Curation :Collaboration comme Soin :</strong> Les autrices, qui collaborent depuis 2009, mettent en avant l’importance de l’interdépendance intellectuelle au-delà des besoins physiques. Elles critiquent la primauté du travail solo dans le monde académique et artistique et montrent comment leurs différentes vitesses de traitement de l’information et leurs horaires de sommeil opposés enrichissent leur collaboration. Elles soulignent également la nécessité de déconstruire les hiérarchies académiques implicites, en reconnaissant le rôle moteur de Jessica dans de nombreux projets. Pour elles, “Interdependent thinking is the crip alchemy that makes our collaborations a critical form of care and that makes our care work a critical crip practice.” Elles ont étendu ce principe aux artistes en encourageant les collaborations et en valorisant les relations existantes entre eux.</li> <li><strong>Intersectionnalité comme Soin :</strong> Les autrices reconnaissent leur position de femmes blanches identifiées à la disability et leur responsabilité dans le démantèlement de la suprématie blanche. Elles affirment qu’une pratique curatoriale “crip” doit centrer les personnes marginalisées de multiples façons et que les curateurs doivent agir comme des structures de soutien pour amplifier d’autres voix. L’intersectionnalité est essentielle pour déconstruire l’idée que la disability existe en dehors de la race, du genre, de la sexualité, de la classe et de la nationalité. Les exemples de Sami Schalk, Black Power Naps (Navild Acosta et Fannie Sosa), Raisa Kabir, Kiyan Williams et Jill Casid illustrent comment l’intersection des identités et des systèmes d’oppression est au cœur de leur travail curatorial. Par exemple, concernant le travail de Navild Acosta et Fannie Sosa, elles écrivent : “The bodies of enslaved people were defined as inherently disabled as a means of justifying enslavement; anyone who resisted by seeking rest or escape was further pathologized… When Navild and Sosa work to reclaim rest, they offer a powerful retort to ableist ideologies that still pathologize rest to justify the consumption and disposability of bipoc bodies.”</li> <li><strong>Accès comme Soin :</strong> Au-delà de l’accessibilité physique traditionnelle, les autrices adoptent le concept d‘“access intimacy” de Mia Mingus, qui décrit “that elusive, hard to describe feeling when someone else ‘gets’ your access needs.” Le passage à un format en ligne a nécessité une réflexion proactive sur les besoins des publics et des artistes en matière d’accès, allant au-delà de la simple connexion Wi-Fi. Cela incluait la prise en compte du “crip time” des artistes, l’intégration de descriptions audio, de sous-titres (comme ceux de Salerno positionnés au centre de l’image en anglais et en espagnol) et d’interprétation en ASL. Elles citent l’exemple de Raisa Kabir qui a pris le temps de construire une description visuelle détaillée de son œuvre avant même sa diffusion, encourageant le public à prendre soin de son corps pendant le visionnage. Pour les curatrices, “we needed to create access as a kind of radical welcome.”</li> <li><strong>“Crip Materiality” :</strong> Jessica Cooley développe également le concept de “crip materiality” comme une tactique curatoriale qui valorise les objets d’art que les normes traditionnelles pourraient considérer comme dégradés ou inappropriés. Cela offre une nouvelle perspective sur l’accès à l’art en considérant la condition matérielle de l’œuvre elle-même. L’inclusion des sculptures de Kiyan Williams faites de terre et de champignons, matériaux considérés comme “décomposés” ou “jetables” par les idéologies validistes, illustre cette approche. Les autrices posent la question : “What happens when the inclusion of precarious material forms in artworks are considered as a model for how to care for precarious material forms in human life?”</li> <li><strong>Appel à l’Action :</strong> Les autrices concluent en lançant un appel aux institutions, aux praticiens et aux audiences pour repenser leurs approches en matière de création, de valorisation et de réception de l’art à travers le prisme du soin “crip”. Elles interrogent les institutions sur leur capacité à intégrer le “crip time”, à soutenir la collaboration, à inclure la disability dans leurs initiatives DEI et à envisager l’accès de manière proactive. Elles encouragent les praticiens à intégrer l’accessibilité dès la conception des œuvres et à déconstruire les usages métaphoriques dommageables de la disability. Elles appellent les audiences à dépasser le sentimentalisme et à s’engager avec la complexité des représentations de la disability. En fin de compte, elles invitent chacun à transformer sa discipline et sa pratique créative pour créer une inclusivité réelle et systémique. Elles reconnaissent que ce travail est “messy, difficult, contradictory work; it is also among the most humane that we, in our imperfect, impermanent, impeccable bodies, can undertake.”</li></ul> <h3 id="lien-avec-la-thèse"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lien-avec-la-thèse"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Lien avec la thèse</h3> <p>Ce document met en lumière une approche curatoriale innovante et profondément engagée, plaçant le soin, la collaboration, l’intersectionnalité (faire attention au vocabulaire) et l’accès au cœur de la pratique artistique et curatoriale. Il offre une critique essentielle des normes validistes et suprémacistes blanches qui sous-tendent souvent le monde de l’art et propose des pistes concrètes pour une transformation inclusive.</p> <p>J’apprécie leur méthodologie qui intègre le care à toutes les étapes du processus et auprès de tou·te·s les intervenant·e·s. Il s’agit d’une approche non individualiste, ce qui me plaît particulièrement. J’aimerais tenter de l’adopter dans le cadre de ma recherche doctorale sur la conservation de l’exposition. L’exposition étant un projet fondamentalement collectif, où coopèrent de nombreux acteurs, œuvres et autres entités, cette méthodologie me semble particulièrement pertinente.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#notes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Notes</h3> <p>%% begin annotations %%</p> <h3 id="citations-importées-le-2025-04-12-559-pm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#citations-importées-le-2025-04-12-559-pm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Citations importées le 2025-04-12 5:59 pm</h3> <p>What is crip curation, and what’s care got to do with it? <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=5&amp;annotation=SIXJ3VRH">(p. 5)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>Disability is, to paraphrase the late Paul Longmore, everywhere and nowhere at the same time; it is omnipresent as a heavily determined signifier, yet those tropes need defamiliarization, particularly in visual representations.1 <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=5&amp;annotation=QKM7QYUF">(p. 5)</a></p></blockquote> <p>his is a manifesto, a guide, and a call for artists and curators to create crip art, performances, and exhibitions that do not hinge on disability as a singular, siloed issue. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=6&amp;annotation=8HLJSPAX">(p. 6)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>This is a call to care for the ways in which identity is always already informed by all of who we are, and how those intersecting identities become trapped under the weight of those oppressive values constructed by ableist, white supremacist, hetero-patriarchal society. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=6&amp;annotation=M2NIDBDV">(p. 6)</a></p></blockquote> <p>the cultural moment and the precepts of disability justice demanded that our antiracist work be proactive rather than reactive. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=11&amp;annotation=9Z2THMCI">(p. 11)</a></p> <p>prioritizing intersectionality within our work was a powerful form of care <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=11&amp;annotation=4T5S5G6F">(p. 11)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>What we define as “collaboration as care” is also a purposeful sharing of our platform so that others can amplify the work of their communities. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=11&amp;annotation=FAXZ474T">(p. 11)</a></p></blockquote> <p>This also allows us to be decentered as organizing forces.

Thus, crip materiality is a critical point of care for the material existence of art objects themselves. Indisposable makes use of crip materiality to rethink what artworks to include in the physical exhibition and how artists who might not seem to engage disability directly in fact do so through their use of precarious materials. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=16&amp;annotation=3BZ5R4YG">(p. 16)</a></p></blockquote> <p>What happens when the inclusion of precarious material forms in artworks are considered as a model for how to care for precarious material forms in human life? <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DYV8GUSA?page=16&amp;annotation=KEDAXJ5D">(p. 16)</a></p> <p>We call on audiences to not mistake sentiment for care, particularly a kind of pathos that reinscribes contempt for the disabled body.

Ce regain d’intérêt est notamment porté par le groupe de recherche CIÉCO et le comité CIDOC de l’ICOM. Selon Longtin, ces expositions sont essentielles car elles représentent “le lieu où une collection prend réellement son sens pour certaines personnes et ce que l’on souhaitait transmettre avec la présentation (et la promotion) de telle ou telle œuvre” (p. 6).</p> <ul><li><strong>Le rôle des musées nationaux dans la construction identitaire :</strong> Les musées nationaux, tels que le MNBAQ et le MAC, conservent et présentent des collections nationales qui contribuent à la construction d’un narratif et d’une identité nationale. Longtin cite Simon J. Knell pour appuyer cette idée, affirmant que ces musées sont des “sites essentiels de changements sociaux et politiques, de construction d’un narratif national et du développement politique d’une nation” (p. 6). Les expositions de leurs collections sont donc des actes curatoriaux qui façonnent la perception du patrimoine et de l’identité québécoise.</li> <li><strong>Les pratiques documentaires et archivistiques des expositions de collections :</strong> Le rapport examine en détail les pratiques de documentation et d’archivage au MNBAQ et au MAC. Longtin constate que si la documentation des collections (fiches d’œuvres, etc.) est bien établie, celle des expositions, et particulièrement des expositions de collections, est moins formalisée. Elle souligne un manque de protocoles standardisés et s’interroge sur les critères de sélection et de pérennisation des archives d’expositions.</li> <li><strong>La diffusion numérique comme enjeu majeur :</strong> La diffusion numérique des archives et des informations relatives aux collections et aux expositions est présentée comme un enjeu crucial pour l’accessibilité, la transparence et la valorisation du patrimoine muséal. Longtin explore les initiatives numériques des deux musées, notamment le MACrépertoire, et les défis liés à la mise en ligne (ressources financières et humaines, droits d’auteur, etc.).</li> <li><strong>Les perspectives et recommandations des professionnels :</strong> À travers des entretiens avec des professionnels des archives et de la conservation du MNBAQ et du MAC, Longtin recueille leurs points de vue sur les pratiques actuelles, les besoins et l’avenir de la documentation et de la diffusion numérique des expositions de collections. L’idée d’une base de données collaborative regroupant la documentation des expositions est notamment discutée.</li></ul> <h3 id="idées-principales"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#idées-principales"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Idées principales</h3> <ul><li><strong>Historique des musées nationaux québécois :</strong> Le rapport retrace la genèse du MNBAQ (initialement le Musée de la province, créé en 1922) et du MAC (inauguré en 1964), soulignant leur rôle comme émanations de la volonté politique de l’État québécois d’affirmer sa culture. Contrairement aux musées nationaux issus de collections privées, ceux du Québec résultent d’une “intervention étatique fortement politique visant à affirmer la place de la culture québécoise dans l’écosystème muséal” (p. 9).</li> <li><strong>Évolution de la présentation des collections :</strong> Au MNBAQ, les collections ont historiquement servi de “décor” aux expositions temporaires (p. 10). Le MAC, quant à lui, présente sa collection de manière presque exclusivement temporaire depuis 1965 (p. 12).</li> <li><strong>Défis de l’archivage muséal :</strong> Longtin met en lumière le paradoxe où les objets des collections bénéficient d’une gestion documentaire privilégiée par rapport aux archives institutionnelles, y compris celles des expositions. Les codes de déontologie des musées insistent sur la documentation des œuvres mais abordent peu la gestion des documents institutionnels (p. 20).</li> <li><strong>Importance des archives d’expositions :</strong> Les archives d’expositions sont cruciales pour comprendre “les choix opérés par les conservateur·rice·s responsables des expositions tendent ainsi à construire certains narratifs nationaux qui façonnent l’identité de la société” (p. 7). Leur documentation rend compte de cette construction identitaire.</li> <li><strong>Pratiques de documentation au MNBAQ et au MAC :MNBAQ :</strong> Une documentation visuelle systématique des expositions existe depuis les années 1930. Tous les documents relatifs aux expositions sont conservés et indexés au nom de l’exposition dans les archives institutionnelles. La conservatrice des archives a établi un protocole de documentation interne (p. 40).</li> <li><strong>MAC :</strong> Depuis les années 2000, les documents relatifs aux expositions sont également indexés et archivés au nom de l’exposition. Cependant, il n’existe pas de protocole de documentation des expositions de collections formalisé (p. 32). La conservatrice responsable de la collection a développé sa propre méthodologie d’archivage (p. 30).</li> <li><strong>Le MACrépertoire :</strong> Cet outil numérique développé par le MAC permet de centraliser les informations sur les collections et les expositions, offrant une meilleure accessibilité pour le public et les professionnels. Une partie des données est disponible en données ouvertes sur le site de Données Québec (p. 68-69). Selon la conservatrice, le MACrépertoire a un “impact énorme” en facilitant l’accès à l’information et en renforçant la transparence du musée (p. 70-71).</li> <li><strong>Vision des professionnels sur la diffusion numérique :</strong> Les professionnels interrogés soulignent l’importance de la diffusion numérique pour l’accessibilité et la valorisation des collections et des archives. Au MNBAQ, un projet de numérisation des archives des expositions est envisagé (p. 72). L’idée d’une base de données collaborative regroupant la documentation des expositions à l’échelle québécoise est perçue comme intéressante mais potentiellement complexe à mettre en œuvre en raison des ressources limitées (p. 73-75). La conservatrice du MNBAQ estime qu‘“il serait vraiment chouette d’instaurer une standardisation à l’échelle québécoise” (p. 43).</li> <li><strong>Défis de la diffusion numérique :</strong> Les défis incluent les coûts financiers et humains, la gestion des droits d’auteur, la pérennité des données et la nécessité d’adapter les contenus aux différents publics en ligne (p. 48-58). Philipp Messner parle d’un “déficit démocratique” lorsque le manque de ressources empêche l’accès public aux archives numériques (p. 51).</li></ul> <h3 id="lien-avec-la-thèse"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lien-avec-la-thèse"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Lien avec la thèse</h3> <p>Le rapport de Marianne Longtin met en lumière l’importance croissante de l’étude des expositions de collections nationales et explore les pratiques de documentation et de diffusion numérique au MNBAQ et au MAC. Il révèle des pratiques variables, un intérêt commun pour l’amélioration de l’accessibilité et de la transparence, ainsi que des défis importants liés aux ressources et à la standardisation. L’idée d’une collaboration interinstitutionnelle pour la documentation des expositions apparaît comme une piste intéressante pour l’avenir de la muséologie québécoise.</p> <p>Ce rapport assoit des connaissances précieuses sur le milieu muséal québécois, en particulier sur la manière dont les institutions considèrent la documentation de l’exposition. Il s’appuie sur une enquête de terrain menée auprès de musées majeurs tels que le Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal (MAC), le Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec (MNBAQ), le Musée d’art de Joliette, ainsi que le Musée des beaux-arts du Canada (MBAC).</p> <p>L’autrice a réalisé plusieurs entretiens dont l’accès serait particulièrement enrichissant pour le projet ICOM Documentation, notamment qu’elle a également échangé avec Alexandre Matos mon prédecesseur. Il me semble pertinent de la contacter à ce sujet.</p> <p>Son analyse aborde également la mise en ligne des données et des archives muséales, dressant un état des lieux des pratiques de diffusion numérique. Elle propose en outre une brève comparaison internationale en examinant les stratégies de documentation du Centre Pompidou, du MoMA et du Museo Amparo (Longtin, 2023, p. 69, pdf).</p> <p>Le rapport mobilise également la notion de trace, en lien avec les enjeux mémoriels et les formes de présence de l’exposition après sa clôture. À ce titre, mon propre travail s’inscrit dans la continuité de cette réflexion, tout en approfondissant ses aspects techniques et méthodologiques, notamment à travers l’utilisation de modèles issus des humanités numériques.</p> <p>La perspective de la conservation-restauration enrichit cette recherche en apportant un cadre théorique et pratique qui considère la matérialité et les conditions de pérennisation des œuvres et des dispositifs d’exposition. Elle permet également de penser la documentation non seulement comme un outil de mémoire, mais comme une forme de soin portée aux éléments éphémères de l’exposition – un enjeu central dans le contexte de pratiques muséales contemporaines.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#notes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Notes</h3> <p>%% begin annotations %%</p> <h3 id="citations-importées-le-2025-04-12-747-pm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#citations-importées-le-2025-04-12-747-pm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Citations importées le 2025-04-12 7:47 pm</h3> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>documentation des expositions est variable, qu’elle n’est pas produite de façon systématique et qu’elle ne semble pas soumise à des protocoles institutionnels. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CFSWHK35?page=6&amp;annotation=SPNXMGPQ">(p. 6)</a></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#2ea8e5] Interesting References</p> <p>L’art, une histoire d’expositions (2009) de Glicenstein et les deux volumes Salon to Biennal: Exhibitions That Made Art History.

Peut-être que le ministère de la Culture embarquerait, parce qu’ils doivent réviser leur répertoire sur le patrimoine culturel, ou la SMQ. Il faut avoir des leaders. On n’a pas autant les leaders qu’on avait avant, quand on faisait l’informatisation des collections. Chacun est chez soi et fait ses affaires, mais on fait tous les mêmes [choses]284.  Une mise en commun des données sur les expositions permettrait d’uniformiser et de  stabiliser les autorités relatives aux expositions, comme leurs dates (qui varient  fréquemment selon la source étudiée), les listes d’œuvres, les artistes exposé·e·s, etc. :  Pour les autorités relatives aux expositions, ce serait génial.

Ce temps enrichi favorise un engagement plus profond avec des œuvres qui remettent en question les structures, les systèmes et les temporalités du musée. L’auteure s’appuie sur le concept de “timescape” développé par la sociologue Barbara Adam pour examiner les “timescapes” de la pratique et de la pensée de la conservation, du musée lui-même et des œuvres d’art, et comment ces temporalités différentes, voire conflictuelles, impactent nos pratiques de soin.</p> <h3 id="idées-principales"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#idées-principales"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Idées principales</h3> <ul><li><strong>Le Projet “Reshaping the Collectible” :</strong> Le chapitre prend son point de départ dans le projet de recherche triennal “Reshaping the Collectible: When Artworks Live in the Museum” (2019-2022), financé par la Mellon Foundation. Ce projet, coordonné par Pip Laurenson, alors responsable de la recherche en conservation à la Tate, a permis d’explorer la valeur de la recherche pour le musée, les participants et le domaine de la conservation, notamment en termes de temps accordé au soin.</li> <li>“However, in conversations with staff the value they most commonly identified was that the project bought time, allowing for a different temporality to enter into the “timescapes” of their work in the museum.” (p. 386)</li> <li><strong>Le Concept de “Timescape” :</strong> Laurenson utilise le concept de “timescape” de Barbara Adam, qui met l’accent sur les aspects temporels de la vie et considère les pratiques temporelles contextualisées comme tangibles. Un “timescape” est “the embodiment of practiced approaches to time” (Adam, 1998, p. 10). Adam identifie sept caractéristiques des “timescapes” : les cadres temporels, la temporalité, le timing, le tempo, la durée, la séquence et les modalités temporelles du passé, du présent et du futur.</li> <li><strong>Le “Temps de Soin” et “Faire du Temps” :</strong> L’auteure explore l’idée de “faire du temps” (“making time”) à travers le prisme du travail de Maria Puig de la Bellacasa sur le “temps du sol” (“soil time”). Puig de la Bellacasa distingue trois échelles temporelles imbriquées : le temps de l’époque, le temps ancré (dans la pratique et régi par un ethos productiviste) et le temps incarné (notre expérience quotidienne du temps, axée sur un futur incertain mais appelant à l’action présente).</li> <li>Laurenson soutient que le “temps de soin” (“care time”) implique de “faire du temps” et de s’engager dans la diversité des “timescapes” qui composent le réseau des agences plus-qu’humaines. Ce “faire du temps” ouvre des possibilités d’attention et de soin différentes, contrastant avec les contraintes strictes du temps ancré et des “timescapes” productivistes. Il agit comme une intervention disruptive.</li> <li><strong>Les “Timescapes” du Musée d’Art Contemporain :</strong> Le musée d’art contemporain est caractérisé par une tension inhérente entre ses différents “timescapes” : le temps lent et méticuleux du soin et de la réparation, le rythme effréné des tâches administratives, des foires d’art et des échéances, et le temps institutionnel du musée visant à transcender le présent pour préserver les collections pour l’avenir.</li> <li>Jill Sterrett (2009) décrit le “tempo vif” des musées d’art contemporain, soulignant la nécessité de “keep pace” avec le présent et de valoriser l’agilité. Cependant, elle reconnaît également l’importance d’une perspective temporelle plus longue pour contextualiser l’art. Elle plaide pour des “vitesses variables”.</li> <li>Les processus de décision du musée (exposition, prêt, acquisition) suivent des calendriers prédéterminés qui structurent le tempo du travail et ont un impact direct sur la vie et le soin des œuvres.</li> <li>La montée du “managerialisme” dans le secteur muséal britannique des années 1990 a introduit une logique productiviste qui risque de dévaloriser le “temps de soin” considéré comme “improductif” (Adam, 2004). Les actes de soin profond peuvent être vus comme des actes de résistance à cette logique.</li> <li>L’idée du musée comme institution conçue pour la “collection permanente” et la transcendance du temps peut rendre invisibles les structures créées par l’humain et rendre difficile l’imagination de leur changement (Azoulay, 2019). Cette conception peut être liée à des pratiques impériales et coloniales.</li> <li>Jane Henderson (2020) remet en question la priorité accordée à la préservation pour les générations futures au détriment de l’accès pour les générations actuelles, interrogeant la “restless futurity” de la conservation.</li> <li><strong>Le “Timescape” des Œuvres d’Art :</strong> Les œuvres d’art ont une relation plurielle au temps (Nagel et Wood, 2010). Elles sont créées à un moment donné mais renvoient au passé et se projettent vers leurs futurs récepteurs. Leur transition vers des objets de collection et de préservation implique un processus complexe de négociation (Buskirk, 2003).</li> <li>Fernando Domínguez Rubio (2016) souligne la tension entre la temporalité attendue d’un objet de musée et sa matérialité, insistant sur le travail nécessaire pour maintenir le statut d‘“objet d’art”.</li> <li>Certaines œuvres, qualifiées d‘“objets indisciplinés” (“unruly objects”) par Domínguez Rubio (2014, 2020), résistent aux temporalités et aux régimes de soin du musée.</li> <li>Les œuvres d’art médiatiques (vidéo, audio, film, etc.) sont intrinsèquement indisciplinées en raison de leur dépendance à des technologies en rapide obsolescence et de la nécessité d’une maintenance continue.</li> <li><strong>Études de Cas :</strong> Le chapitre examine trois exemples d’œuvres qui remettent en question les “timescapes” du musée, étudiées dans le cadre du projet “Reshaping the Collectible” :</li> <li><strong>Blessed Bandwidth de Shilpa Gupta (2003) :</strong> Cette œuvre d’art en réseau, conçue comme un projet temporel, dépend de technologies obsolètes (Flash) et interroge la notion d’objet d’art persistant dans le temps.</li> <li><strong>Les œuvres d’Ima Abasi Okon :</strong> L’artiste a incité les conservateurs à ralentir leur travail, à adopter une temporalité différente pour mieux comprendre l’œuvre. Cela s’est manifesté par un refus de l’enregistrement d’entretien et par la mise en place d’un groupe de lecture hebdomadaire. L’installation s’est déroulée sur un temps plus long, privilégiant l’indétermination et l’acceptation de l’incertitude.</li> <li><strong>Ten Years Alive on the Infinite Plain de Tony Conrad (1972) :</strong> L’étude de cette performance sonore et filmique expérimentale a nécessité de retracer son histoire sur cinquante ans, de recueillir des témoignages et de transmettre les connaissances corporelles des anciens interprètes aux nouveaux, soulignant les limites de la documentation et l’importance d’un temps récursif.</li> <li><strong>Conservation, Maintenance et Réparation :</strong> Le soin de ces œuvres implique des pratiques de maintenance et de réparation qui contrastent avec une vision scientifique de percées soudaines. La conservation évolue de manière non linéaire et apprend des formes de soin anciennes et des traditions non occidentales. Ces pratiques reflètent une “éthique de soin et de responsabilité mutuelle” (Jackson, 2014, p. 231).</li> <li><strong>Conclusion :</strong> Laurenson plaide pour le développement et la valorisation de différentes relations de soin au sein du musée, reconnaissant leur valeur sociale, esthétique et spirituelle. Il est possible de modifier les “timescapes” du travail muséal et de permettre à différentes temporalités de coexister. Bien que cela puisse sembler subversif dans une culture dominée par la productivité, c’est une attente du public.</li> <li>“Care time suspends the future and distends the present, thickening it with myriad multilateral demands” (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017, p. 207).</li> <li>L’auteure insiste sur la nécessité de remarquer et de valoriser les différentes temporalités à l’œuvre dans le musée et autour des œuvres d’art, ouvrant ainsi la voie à des modes de soin recalibrés et à la création de “timescapes” alternatifs. Il y a une demande éthique à reconnaître, valoriser et laisser de l’espace à ces temporalités dans un monde risquant d’être uniquement validé par des idées productivistes du temps.</li></ul> <h3 id="lien-avec-la-thèse"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lien-avec-la-thèse"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Lien avec la thèse</h3> <p>Je vais mobiliser ce texte dans ma thèse pour plusieurs raisons. Premièrement, il offre une réflexion précieuse sur le rapport au temps dans les pratiques de conservation-restauration au sein des institutions muséales. L’auteure souligne notamment que la conservation ne s’adresse pas uniquement aux générations futures, mais qu’elle répond avant tout aux besoins de la génération présente (p. 389). Ensuite, ce texte constitue une première entrée pertinente pour penser le care en conservation-restauration. Laurenson propose en effet des exemples concrets de soin apporté à des œuvres complexes, notamment des installations multimédias, illustrant ainsi une approche sensible et contextualisée de la conservation.</p> <p>J’émets toutefois une réserve quant au cadre institutionnel dans lequel s’inscrit cette recherche, qui laisse peu de place aux œuvres et aux espaces marginalisés. La notion de care, bien qu’esquissée dans le traitement des œuvres complexes, n’est pas mobilisée ici pour interroger les exclusions ou pour introduire des perspectives issues de pratiques périphériques ou non institutionnelles.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#notes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Notes</h3> <p>%% begin annotations %%</p> <h3 id="citations-importées-le-2025-04-12-508-pm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#citations-importées-le-2025-04-12-508-pm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Citations importées le 2025-04-12 5:08 pm</h3> <p>project bought time, allowing for a different temporality to enter into the “timescapes” of their work in the museum. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=386&amp;annotation=46WWPG3F">(p. 386)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#a28ae5] Vocabulary, Names, Dates, Definition</p> <p>“timescape” as developed by Barbara Adam (1998, 2008). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=386&amp;annotation=J9IA6EUJ">(p. 386)</a></p></blockquote> <p>Barbara Adam has identified seven features of timescapes: timeframes, temporality, timing, tempo, duration, sequence and the temporal modalities of past, present and future (Adam 2008). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=386&amp;annotation=2F3L8XU6">(p. 386)</a></p> <p>project Reshaping the Collectible had explored ideas of care, in particular in relation to the social networks surrounding and sustaining particular artworks we were studying (Geismar 2022; Laurenson 2022) <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=386&amp;annotation=V52237RV">(p. 386)</a></p> <p>“the fostering of the endurance of objects through time” (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017, p. 171) <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=386&amp;annotation=RAJQ3SIS">(p. 386)</a></p> <p>resisted and refused the timescapes of the museum and served to expose these assumed temporalities <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=ARN3BU9D">(p. 387)</a></p> <p>She sees epoch time as marked by the linear imperative of progress that harbours a fear of regression. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=BDNSZSR5">(p. 387)</a></p> <p>Embedded time is understood as time that is embedded in practice and that is paced to a productionist ethos. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=QB2IGHXJ">(p. 387)</a></p> <p>Embodied time is our everyday experience of time which Bellacasa argues is focussed on an uncertain future but calls us to act now. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=XTGU8XTM">(p. 387)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#2ea8e5] Interesting References</p> <p>(Puig de la Bellacasa 2017, p. 175). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=BF7Z7KAD">(p. 387)</a></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>care time entails “making time” and in getting involved in the diversity of timescapes that make up the web of more than human agencies. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=DDEZ6B75">(p. 387)</a></p></blockquote> <p>disruptive intervention within the dominant temporal landscape <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=VKS8JLJH">(p. 387)</a></p> <blockquote><p>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical</p> <p>while a display or exhibition is being installed and can feel at odds with the other paces and schedules encountered in the museum. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=WA99ZLMI">(p. 387)</a></p></blockquote> <p>The contemporary art museum holds within it an inherent tension between its different timescapes that often feel at odds with each other. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9TXBD8LY?page=387&amp;annotation=CMXLMGSK">(p. 387)</a></p> <p>“Contemporary art is about now and, as such, museums of contemporary art are called upon to keep pace.
