abstract: It has been widely acknowledged that reinstallations and re-executions of contemporary artworks substantially rely on available documentation. Especially for installations and performances it is crucial to record the artist’s intent, past iterations, and tacit knowledge involved in staging the artwork. The growing presence of contemporary artworks in museum collections increases the importance of documentation as a central focus of collection care. However, collections management systems have limitations in adequately presenting these often rich forms of documentation. Consequently, documentation required for presenting a speciﬁc complex artwork is often dispersed across multiple systems, drives, and dossiers inside various departments. In recent years, several initiatives responded to these challenges by implementing a digital platform supporting the conservation of contemporary art. Collaborative networked software such as wiki came into focus as a prominent choice for managing the related documentation. The wiki promises to integrate diverse material in one place and accommodate much-needed requirements such as multiple iterations of an artwork, relations between its elements, and multimedia content. This paper takes the case of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)’s experimental use of MediaWiki to determine whether and under what conditions a wiki is capable of supporting collection care suﬃciently in terms of documenting time-based media art. The case further illustrates the consequence of adopting a content management system as knowledge base for conservation. While collections management systems are designed primarily to handle objects using forms, wikis are publishing platforms in the ﬁrst place and provide a diﬀerent kind of framework for artwork records. They are designed to employ text and media to compose articles. We propose to conceptualise this consequential role of conservator as a manager of content, an editor.

these components are replaceable, vehicular media (Laurenson 2014), however their parameters are still significant to the final form of the work [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=2&annotation=75F8DWVG)


To gain confidence in restaging such works, collecting institutions respond by accumulating documentation across systems and departments. 
However, when it comes to the exhibition, locating relevant bits of information often yields a painstaking process. This paper takes the case of SFMOMA’s treatment of media installations and argues that documentation management is a threefold issue. Besides adapting information systems to the cause, of the same importance are the intra- and inter-institutional collaboration and the acknowledgment of the role of conservator as a content manager [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=2&annotation=3LRYUVNU)


presentation of these works demands supplanting the idea of restoring the original state of an artwork by that of installing its iterations and acknowledging the fact that through each installation the work changes anew [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=UDKMIXXL)


So when not installed, the work cannot be perceived and only ‘exists’ in the form of instructions and documentation (Laurenson 2001; Phillips 2015, 173).2 This condition poses greater needs on documentation and its management, which in the case of such works is a complex matter (Heydenreich 2011).

To document a time-based media artwork,3 Laurenson (2001) suggests to identify its components and elements (possibly including the space and acoustics), explain how they are connected, describe their roles in terms of aesthetics and functionality, and establish the factors most likely to prevent each component from fulfilling its role [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=E8GVZFU6)


Laurenson (2006) later introduced into conservation research the concept of allographicity in order to expand the focus in media conservation from the materiality of painting and sculpture to also include temporality and ephemerality typical for media installations [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=YUAMQ4BW)


Like in musical works, interpretation is often necessary and it constitutes the second phase of the work’s creation [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=HHCWQ7SY)


Building upon this concept, Phillips (2015) developed a model dividing the documentation work into two stages. The first looks at its ‘score’ in general that includes the work’s identity and installation, and the second at its distinct iterations through the perspective of components, parameters and decision-making involved. [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=L4FJ8D4Q)


The importance of documentation in museum agendas varies widely, but it stands in the centre of the work of contemporary art conservation and is key in collection care since the lives of these works of art depend on it (e.g. Dekker 2013; Matos 2015) [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=5MRWVUUE)

Taylor (2014, 129) describes challenges for collecting media art in terms of defining the work in collections management systems. Ippolito (2008) notes the inability of cataloguing systems to describe the roles and changing cast of characters for an evolving work, nor the variability of its other identification elements.

Phillips states that since collection databases prescribe ‘the notion of the artwork as a contained entity with a fixed set of components, reporting different iterations of the same artwork and tracking varying component constellations for these iterations is not easily possible.’ These systems do not allow ‘to isolate components from the artwork’s component list – e.g. to create a relational history of component clusters – or even to document interventions and decision-making on a component level’ (2015, 172). [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=7HZPP2RE)


The stages of its life in the collection – acquisition, exhibitions, and loans – generate a varied set of documents: installation instructions, identity, condition and treatment reports, artist interviews, artist statements, correspondence, preventive conservation requirements, etc [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=PDT9L6HI)


To complicate matters, these documents come in a variety of media formats as text, image, video, audio, and code [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=8UFJAWCH)


The documentation needed for restaging media installations therefore results in the complex structures of files, folders, and drives subjected to intricate hierarchies of access and distributed over multiple systems [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=QDVICAIR)


dispersion often results in ‘siloing’ information inside various departments, which effectively prevents research and collaboration in museums [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=39W6ZVDD)

To understand the piece, one needs to be able to easily navigate the great variety of elements related to its documentation and conservation. Besides having access to its recorded identity and installation instructions, one must also be able to consult various iterations of the work and, for each, learn about decision making involved on the component level as well as about relations between its elements, supported by multimedia content where necessary [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=U4Q8ARKP)


Beyond infrastructure, we argue that organising the access to dispersed, varied, and complex [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=3&annotation=BKM3NX4N)


documentation is an issue of collaboration across (and beyond) departments, and of the role of conservator as a content manager. The three aspects – infrastructure, collaboration, and content management – are mutually intertwined. [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=4&annotation=SAH236TI)


MediaWiki, is a content management system originally built for the Wikipedia encyclopaedia.

interdisciplinary team.’ Laurenson notes that the model ‘recognises that responding effectively to changing artistic practice involves an engagement throughout the museum.’ She adds that it can only be successful with ‘a commitment and an institutional culture of collaborative working,’ while its strength is that it does not require recruiting more personnel or outsourcing the responsibility for works [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=5&annotation=2NBGC4DD)

Martina Haidvogl has designed a system to document complex art installations [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=6&annotation=P48NUU6V)


One of the main challenges was to coordinate this process. The original intention was that the members of staff involved in setting up an installation would print out relevant documents and file them in the respective folder. However, in practice, Haidvogl assumed the role of requesting particular people for particular documents with various levels of urgency, and of filing. The conservator hesitantly took up the role of managing the overall editorial process. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=7&annotation=W85TMAVC)


Descriptions of components of the work, the intention behind it, and various spatial and technical dependencies are accumulated in mailboxes and hard drives of curators, conservators, and other staff [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=7&annotation=4F36LS4H)

Introducing another system into this framework demands addressing justified concerns over creating redundancy and further scattering of documentation [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=8&annotation=JTNG6QXZ)


Another concern is that learning and maintaining a wiki requires a special lasting effort from the members of the staff. Hence its embedment in the information space needs to be negotiated [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=8&annotation=8KFXS7JW)

contain thousands of distinct objects – an archive of items rather than a set of ‘components’. [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&annotation=PCU7QXB4)


Adhering to a strict report structure would make it harder to accommodate certain types of artworks, causing documentation to again flow over to other systems. In consequence, while standard collections management systems are subjects to data entry where conservators fill out pre-existing forms, wikis are primarily publishing systems, allowing them to adapt templates to specificities of each artwork and so shape documentation in both content and form. [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&annotation=RGJQEUI6)


As indicated above, standard museum information systems do not leave much room for variability and reduce artworks into fixed categories (Van Saaze 2013, 167). One consequence of this situation is that the amount of forms and entries per artwork is so high they need to be split into numerous panels, sidebars, menus, and screens. The resulting complexity prevents staff from consulting more than only certain aspects and fragments of a given artwork at once. 
This makes it hard to grasp changing artworks such as installations and performances. The descriptive fixity of systems leads to complex interfaces [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&annotation=FTEKDFBE)


The consideration of content management alongside collection management requires rethinking the conservator’s role in documentation as well [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&annotation=3T8BZ3C2)


We argue that rather than data entry, the conservator documenting an artwork in this way does the work of editing. The tradition of editing offers a useful framework to conceptualise further this aspect of conservation. [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&annotation=SFCRWLZT)

Susan L. Greenberg (2018) [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&annotation=LEA86DSS)


Her understanding of editing as ‘a decision-making process, usually within the framework of a professional practice, which aims to select, shape and link the text, thereby putting it into a context that helps to deliver the meaning and significance of the work to its readers’ (Greenberg 2018, 14 [(p. 14)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=14&annotation=CYM5UHYC)


Operating content management systems in museums has been mostly the domain of ‘digital’ departments operating the websites of their institutions. The people in those departments are the ones to reach out for collaboration. At the same time, documenting and editing artworks on a wiki may bring together the many voices of conservators, registrars, curators, and technicians in articulating the contributions of their own professions to the meaning and significance of works in their care. 
It also sheds a new light on the often repeated statement that art installations only exist when they are installed. 
Compiling and editing relevant documentation not only prepares us better for their live episodes in galleries, but helps us treat them as being present and alive in institutional memory. [(p. 15)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YEBCNKTM?page=15&annotation=ZYDDXMW4)
