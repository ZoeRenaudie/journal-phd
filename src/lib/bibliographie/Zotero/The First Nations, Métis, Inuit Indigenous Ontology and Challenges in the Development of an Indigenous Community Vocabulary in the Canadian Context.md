abstract: Creating and implementing Indigenous-led thesauri and vocabularies for wide adoption by cultural memory institutions is essential to providing respectful terminology to describe materials by and about Indigenous peoples in the territory referred to as Canada. This article details the background, creation, and reflections on the First Nation, Métis, and Inuit, Indigenous Ontology (FNMIIO), up to the release of the first draft in June 2019 as well as more recent initiatives and transformations. Grounded in the recommendations developed by the Canadian Federation of Library Associations’ (CFLA) Truth and Reconciliation Committee, the article discusses the creation of the FNMIIO as an important first step in addressing the need for a widely adoptable, Indigenous run and led thesaurus for use in cultural memory institutions. The article discusses both the methods undertaken in the project and the challenges faced in the development of the FNMIIO and connects the challenges to issues in libraries and the cultural heritage sector in the territory known as Canada as a whole. While a crucial proof-of-concept, the FNMIIO exposed several important issues that must be addressed to fully develop the thesaurus, particularly with respect to ensuring the longevity of the project. While much work remains to make the FNMIIO fully usable by institutions, the initial lessons learned by the CFLA Indigenous Matters Committee’s Joint Working Group as they progressed through the gathering of community names will undergird the next steps for the development and deployment of the FNMIIO.

A critical revelation in discussions of decolonization and descriptive practices in libraries and other cultural organizations is the connection between law, government policy, and classification and documentation. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=2&annotation=QSZCHJ5A)


The Act, and its numerous amendments, brought in a whole host of laws restricting freedom of movement, denied cultural practice and language, and denied full participation in Canadian society without loss of “status” as an Indian with the fundamental goal being the disappearance of Indigenous peoples through assimilation into white culture.

work with Indigenous (First Nations, Métis and Inuit) people to address issues related to libraries, archives and cultural memory institutions; to promote initiatives in all types of libraries by advancing and implementing meaningful reconciliation as addressed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report and in the Calls to Action to implement the recommendations of the CFLA-FCAB Truth and Reconciliation Committee report; to monitor ongoing progress in those areas; and to promote collaboration in these issues across Canadian libraries, archives, and cultural memory institutions.

Understanding the relationship between the CFLA-TRC Medicine Wheel framework and the work on subject headings and vocabularies is important to understanding how this work relates to the larger mission and work of the larger committee. The fifth recommendation of the CFLATRC report states libraries should “Decolonize Access and Classification by addressing the structural biases in existing schemes of knowledge organization and information retrieval arising from colonialism by committing to integrating Indigenous epistemologies into cataloguing praxis and knowledge management.” (Callison et al. 2017, p.6) The Report affirms the potential roles the Red Team would play in addressing this recommendation: “The Truth & Reconciliation Committee’s Red Team is about moving to the future and the decolonization of libraries and archives and their practices. [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=5&annotation=4FVQSDDD)


As such, the team will be looking at Access and Classification, Indigenous Knowledge Protection, Outreach and Service, and Decolonizing Libraries and Space.” The Red Team was further broken down into more specific areas, with the group tasked with looking at access and classification known as the Red Team on Subject Headings, thus grounding the addressing of subject headings with a future-focus.

Culturally appropriate subject headings mean that individuals can access materials through subject headings in their own language and do not have to encounter outdated and potentially racist terminology and the CFLA-TRC connects the use of subject headings to the TRC’s 94 Calls to Action (2015). [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=6&annotation=TWRGFBGJ)


The CFLA-TRC Report outlined five key recommendations needed within the areas of cataloguing and classification to help meet the TRC’s 94 Calls to Action. [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=6&annotation=NLXFDFAL)

That our major thesauri used for cataloguing in the English-speaking world were built on oppressive understandings of the world is not a new concept in our field. [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=7&annotation=VNRCRJBD)


>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical
The problem with modifying widely adopted thesauri goes beyond the fact that they are widely used and deeply embedded in our cataloguing infrastructure. [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=8&annotation=MD99QZN3)

Given this existing landscape, the CFLA-TRC Report made a strong case for the need for the development of a new schema for Indigenous subject headings, but at the same time recognize that new terminology must be reflective of the plurality of worldviews within contemporary library and information spaces and the transitions and translations that have occurred over time. The CFLA-TRC Report (2017) states: “new systems must acknowledge and reflect centuries of transactions and hybridity between Indigenous and Western knowledge systems that have resulted in cross fertilization between these worldviews.” (Callison et al., p. 29) [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=8&annotation=MWIDCYE4)


At the time of writing, there is no national or international organization supporting the development and implementation of a large-scale, Indigenous led thesaurus of appropriate terms that is in an easily consumable format for our current systems.

Tharani has pointed to the benefits of using specialized, local approaches and repository software when documenting non-Western knowledges and materials (Tharani, 2020). A key advantage to this more localized approach is that it enables libraries to customize their catalogues to the specificities of the communities that they serve. While local, customized options can deploy knowledge organization systems that fit local needs and collections well, they are not constructed in a way that makes them easily adaptable to other collections and are not meant to be used at scale. These schemas “work well for small, local collections but might not translate to a national level given the diversity of Indigenous cultures. In other words, professionals must be conscious of the risk of embedding Westernized conceptions of pan-Aboriginality into new systems.” (Callison et al., p. 29) [(p. 8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=8&annotation=M62SVJHD)


The vision for the FNMIIO was to bring together experts already involved in these ongoing projects and work collectively to share existing knowledge and build a new thesaurus for wide adoption in the territory known as Canada.

While the FNMIIO is often referenced as a reliable source for community names by many organizations, particularly Canadian academic libraries, it is unclear whether any cultural memory institutions have adopted the ontology for use in their systems. [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=9&annotation=LRBF3GIW)


The question of whether a community is bounded by legal, geographic, temporal, or other definitions left the JWG with many unanswered questions regarding how best to proceed with the terminology, particularly as the terminology was intended to serve general purpose situations, unlike other systems that are more specifically related to Nations or collections. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=10&annotation=URCHP35Q)


The heterogeneity of “community” also serves as a reminder that Indigenous peoples are diverse and that any future modeling work will need to account for the variations in conceptualization and worldviews. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=10&annotation=6LSNBXYW)


>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical
While the creation of this general-purpose list was a laudable goal, the implications of this ambiguous modelling has meant that the terminology and data collected was uneven and problematic in the context of developing a usable system of terms. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=10&annotation=8N9MNSB7)

Further modelling will be required in order to properly map and describe “community” in its myriad forms so that the complexity and multiplicity of the concept may be fully represented in the ontology. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=10&annotation=FLVSNNDH)

The primary challenge with MARC as an encoding schema is its inextricable link to colonial, Anglo-American cataloguing rules and infrastructures, which may be incompatible with the burgeoning model of FNMIIO. [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FFISG7WC?page=10&annotation=DCYYDYUU)


>[!quote|#5fb236] Very Important or Critical
As stated throughout the article, Indigenous peoples must be able to be known and described by their own names. Therefore, the FNMIIO must remain Indigenous-led and run to ensure that continued development and maintenance is done by Indigenous people and for Indigenous people in ways that remain respectful to these peoples, and counter to existing colonial naming structures and processes.
